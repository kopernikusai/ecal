Applications
============================

In the following sections we will look at the most important applications that ship with eCAL.

We will start with the eCAL Monitor that is mainly useful for debugging, as it lets you easily see what is going on in your eCAL network.

We then look at the eCAL Recorder and eCAL Player. Those applications let you record and replay snapshots of eCAL traffic.
